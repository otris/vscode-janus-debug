### 0.0.7 (YYYY-MM-DD)

WIP

Following issues have been fixed in this release:

  - The debugger stops now immediately when a breakpoint is hit or the program halts ([#57] (https://github.com/otris/vscode-janus-debug/issues/57)).
  - The version and commit number are now printed out on the console when the debug extension is activated ([#39]
  (https://github.com/otris/vscode-janus-debug/issues/39)).
  - The extension comes with a lovely icon now ðŸ‘Š ([#31] (https://github.com/otris/vscode-janus-debug/issues/31).
  - User can now change all network related timeouts from within `launch.json` file ([#51](https://github.com/otris/vscode-janus-debug/issues/51)).
  - Some minor errors have been fixed when a new `launch.json` was created from previously entered data ([5c45fa0](https://github.com/otris/vscode-janus-debug/commit/5c45fa0ee06c19ca2b1f1641cdce89e200175c16)).

### 0.0.6 (2017-06-21)

Besides the usual minor fixes and corrections, this release adds the new Server Console output. This allows you to see the server's log lines directly in VS Code! (For more info, see this PR: [#47](https://github.com/otris/vscode-janus-debug/pull/47)).

### 0.0.5 (2017-06-02)

Most notable in this release: We have merged _vscode-documents-scripting_ and _vscode-janus-debug_ extensions into one single extension. Users do not need to install multiple extensions anymore to get the full experience. We hope that this makes development much easier and faster.

Lots of bugs have been fixed in this release:

  - Setting breakpoints is more reliable now ([#12](https://github.com/otris/vscode-janus-debug/issues/12)). Thanks to [ChDxterWard](https://github.com/ChDxterWard).
  - Fixed problems with encrypted and decrypted scripts. The encryption states are now read from DOCUMENTS server prior to every upload. The `// #crypt` entry in a script should work now as expected.
  - Fixed an issue that prevented connecting the debugger to a DOCUMENTS 5 server ([#23](https://github.com/otris/vscode-janus-debug/issues/23)). Sorry!

### 0.0.4 (2017-05-17)

This release includes two important bug fixes that make creating a launch.json file and connecting to a remote server much more reliable.

### 0.0.3 (2017-05-08)

No big changes. Timeouts are configurable via launch.json now.

### 0.0.2 (2017-03-22)

Initial release of the extension. Running and debugging simple scripts directly from within VS Code on a JANUS-based server works! ðŸŽ‰
