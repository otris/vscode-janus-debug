## Changelog

You'll find a complete list of changes at our project site on [GitHub](https://github.com/otris/vscode-janus-debug).

### 0.0.8 (2017-07-07)



- Loging is now additionally available in the extension of VS Code and not only in the DebugAdapter. To activate this feature you have to
  add an Object called vscode-janus-debug.log to the settings.json containging information about the path to the logfile (fileName) and
  the loglevel (logLevel). ([#30](https://github.com/otris/vscode-janus-debug/issues/30))
 
New Features:

- Users can now write DOCUMENTS scripts in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and then use the command `Upload JS from TS` to compile the TypeScript file and upload the corresponding JavaScript ([#55](https://github.com/otris/vscode-janus-debug/issues/55)).
- Users can now download a script from the server via the context menu when using right-click on a folder.
- Users will be asked before passwords will be written in plain-text to the project's `launch.json` file.
- The extension comes with a lovely icon now ðŸ‘Š ([#31](https://github.com/otris/vscode-janus-debug/issues/31)).

Following issues have been fixed in this release:

  - The debugger stops now immediately when a breakpoint is hit or the script halts ([#57](https://github.com/otris/vscode-janus-debug/issues/57)).
  - The version and commit number are now printed out on the console when the extension is activated ([#39](https://github.com/otris/vscode-janus-debug/issues/39)).
  - Users can now change all network related timeouts from within `launch.json` file ([#51](https://github.com/otris/vscode-janus-debug/issues/51)). Previously, not all timeouts where configurable.
  - Some minor errors have been fixed when a new `launch.json` is created when the user uploads a script the first time. ([5c45fa0](https://github.com/otris/vscode-janus-debug/commit/5c45fa0ee06c19ca2b1f1641cdce89e200175c16)).

### 0.0.7 (2017-07-07)

Accidentally released.

### 0.0.6 (2017-06-21)

Besides the usual minor fixes and corrections, this release adds the new Server Console output. This allows you to see the server's log lines directly in VS Code! (For more info, see this PR: [#47](https://github.com/otris/vscode-janus-debug/pull/47)).

### 0.0.5 (2017-06-02)

Most notable in this release: We have merged _vscode-documents-scripting_ and _vscode-janus-debug_ extensions into one single extension. Users do not need to install multiple extensions anymore to get the full experience. We hope that this makes development much easier and faster.

Lots of bugs have been fixed in this release:

  - Setting breakpoints is more reliable now ([#12](https://github.com/otris/vscode-janus-debug/issues/12)). Thanks to [ChDxterWard](https://github.com/ChDxterWard).
  - Fixed problems with encrypted and decrypted scripts. The encryption states are now read from DOCUMENTS server prior to every upload. The `// #crypt` entry in a script should work now as expected.
  - Fixed an issue that prevented connecting the debugger to a DOCUMENTS 5 server ([#23](https://github.com/otris/vscode-janus-debug/issues/23)). Sorry!

### 0.0.4 (2017-05-17)

This release includes two important bug fixes that make creating a launch.json file and connecting to a remote server much more reliable.

### 0.0.3 (2017-05-08)

No big changes. Timeouts are configurable via launch.json now.

### 0.0.2 (2017-03-22)

Initial release of the extension. Running and debugging simple scripts directly from within VS Code on a JANUS-based server works! ðŸŽ‰
